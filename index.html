          <h2>💡 Overview</h2>
          <p>
            Hurricane Milton triggered large-scale population movements from Florida into
            neighboring states, with Georgia emerging as one of the most important receiving
            regions. This project investigates where evacuees traveled during the event and
            why certain places attracted more visitors than others.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using high-resolution mobility data and county-level social connection
            measures, we analyze both spatial patterns and behavioral mechanisms shaping
            evacuation destination choices. Two questions guide the analysis:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>R1:</strong> Which locations in Georgia experienced notable increases in visitor activity during Hurricane Milton?</li>
            <li><strong>R2:</strong> How did evacuation orders and social ties influence evacuees’ destination choices?</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The findings provide new insights into how infrastructure, amenities, and
            social networks interact to direct climate-induced population movements.

        <h2>🗺️ Data &amp; Study Area</h2>
        <p>
          We draw on anonymized, device-based mobility traces aggregated to the census-tract level
          to estimate weekly visitation flows from Florida to Georgia. Baseline mobility conditions
          are captured by weekday-specific average visit counts outside the hurricane period, which
          serve as a prediction of expected activity. Deviations from these predicted values reveal
          anomalous increases associated with Hurricane Milton.
        </p>
        <p>
          Florida’s coastline is organized into evacuation zones that differ in exposure to storm
          surge and wind hazards. Hurricane Milton’s track and uncertainty cone intersect several
          of these zones, leading to mandatory evacuation orders in the most vulnerable tracts.
          These areas become the primary origins of evacuees traveling toward Georgia.

    <!-- Visitor Share Change -->

        <h2>🧑🏻‍🤝‍🧑🏻 Visitor Share Change in Georgia</h2>
        <p>
          To quantify how destinations in Georgia were affected, we compute
          <em>visitor share change</em> for each census tract. This metric measures how much
          a tract’s share of visitors from Florida increased during the hurricane week
          relative to its typical share under normal conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
          As shown in the histogram below, most tracts experienced modest changes, but a
          small subset saw disproportionately large increases. This heavy right tail
          indicates that evacuees did not disperse evenly; instead, they concentrated in a
          limited number of locations that offered better accessibility, amenities, or
          existing social ties.
        </p>

    <!-- Why Quantile Regression -->
        <section id="quantile-regression" class="section">
          <div class="container">
            <h2>🛠️ Quantile Regression Analysis</h2>
            <p>
              The distribution of visitor share change is highly skewed: most tracts see only
              small shifts, while a limited number experience very large surges. A standard
              linear regression focuses on the mean and would mostly describe what happens in
              “typical” tracts, potentially missing the dynamics that matter most for
              evacuation planning—namely, the places that become hotspots.
            </p>
            <p>
              Quantile regression is designed for this type of problem. Instead of estimating
              how predictors affect the average outcome, it estimates their effects at
              different points of the distribution (for example, the 10th, 50th, or 90th
              percentile of visitor share change). This allows us to see how the role of
              social ties, accessibility, or amenities changes between lightly affected areas
              and those experiencing extreme increases in evacuee arrivals.
            </p>
            <p>
              This approach is well suited to evacuation data for several reasons:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                It captures <strong>heterogeneous effects</strong>, showing that some factors
                matter mainly for high-visitor tracts rather than everywhere.
              </li>
              <li>
                It is more robust to <strong>outliers and heavy tails</strong> than mean-based
                models, which is important when a few tracts receive a disproportionate number
                of evacuees.
              </li>
              <li>
                It does not require constant variance of errors, making it appropriate when
                variability grows with the level of visitor change.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Interpretation follows the same logic: a positive coefficient for a variable at
              the 0.9 quantile means that, holding other variables constant, an increase in
              that variable raises the 90th percentile of visitor share change. If the same
              coefficient is close to zero at the median, we learn that the factor is
              especially important for <em>high-impact</em> destinations rather than for the
              average tract. This perspective helps identify which characteristics are most
              strongly associated with becoming an evacuation hotspot.

        <h2>Model Fit Across Quantiles</h2>
        <p>
          The pseudo R² values displayed below show that model fit is lowest near the
          middle of the distribution but improves substantially in higher quantiles. This
          pattern suggests that the model is particularly effective at explaining the
          locations where visitor surges were most pronounced.

    <!-- Spatial Patterns -->

        <h2>🌊 Spatial Patterns of Evacuation Origins</h2>
        <p>
          To capture differences in behavior, we distinguish Florida origin tracts that
          were under mandatory evacuation orders from those without such orders.
          Aggregating visitor share changes by these categories reveals distinct spatial
          footprints across Georgia.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tracts in Georgia that show high visitor share increases are more strongly
          connected to origins with mandatory orders, indicating that formal directives
          played an important role in concentrating flows. In contrast, evacuees from
          non-mandatory areas tend to be distributed more broadly across the state.

        <h2>🔍 Determinants of Visitor Concentration</h2>
        <p>
          The quantile regression results provide a detailed picture of what drives
          evacuees toward particular destinations in Georgia.
        </p>

          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          <strong>Social ties</strong> play a central role: tracts with stronger
          county-to-county social connections to Florida origins attract significantly
          more evacuees, particularly at upper quantiles. This highlights how personal
          networks guide destination choice when uncertainty is high.
        </p>

        </figure>
        <p>
          <strong>Distance and accessibility</strong> measures also matter. Greater
          distance from the storm’s trajectory is associated with slightly higher visitor
          shares, reflecting risk avoidance. Proximity to major economic centers and to
          the Atlanta airport has strong positive effects in higher quantiles, suggesting
          that evacuees prefer well-connected locations.
        </p>

          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          Finally, <strong>amenities and local context</strong> shape concentration.
          Hospitality infrastructure—especially hotels and malls—is positively associated
          with visitor surges, while gas stations show weaker or even negative
          relationships at the top of the distribution, possibly reflecting congestion or
          fuel shortages. Higher-income destination tracts also tend to experience larger
          increases among the most-visited locations.
