          <h2>💡 Overview</h2>
          <p>
            Hurricane Milton triggered large-scale population movements from Florida into
            neighboring states, with Georgia emerging as one of the most important receiving
            regions. This project investigates where evacuees traveled during the event and
            why certain places attracted more visitors than others.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using high-resolution mobility data and county-level social connection
            measures, we analyze both spatial patterns and behavioral mechanisms shaping
            evacuation destination choices. Two questions guide the analysis:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>R1:</strong> Which locations in Georgia experienced notable increases in visitor activity during Hurricane Milton?</li>
            <li><strong>R2:</strong> How did evacuation orders and social ties influence evacuees’ destination choices?</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The findings provide new insights into how infrastructure, amenities, and
            social networks interact to direct climate-induced population movements.

        <h2>🌊 Spatial Patterns of Evacuation Origins</h2>
        <p>
          To capture differences in behavior, we distinguish Florida origin tracts that
          were under mandatory evacuation orders from those without such orders.
          Aggregating visitor share changes by these categories reveals distinct evacuation destinations across Georgia.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tracts in Georgia that show high visitor share increases are more strongly
          connected to origins with mandatory orders (hence darker shade areas in the left map). In contrast, evacuees from
          non-mandatory areas tend to be distributed more broadly across the state.

          We draw on anonymized, device-based mobility traces aggregated to the census-tract level
          to estimate weekly visitation flows from Florida to Georgia. Following the practice from existing studies (Anyidoho et al., 2023; Hong & Frias-Martinez, 2020), baseline mobility conditions
          are captured by weekday-specific average visit counts three weeks prior to the hurricane period, which
          serve as a prediction of baseline activity. Deviations from these predicted values reveal
          anomalous increases associated with Hurricane Milton.

          Florida Division of Emergency Management (FDEM) organizes evacuation zones in Florida that differ in exposure to storm
          surge and wind hazards. Hurricane Milton’s track (<a href="https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/data/">NOAA's HURDAT2 Dataset</a>) intersect several
          of these zones. Based on news articles and county government agencies' announcements, we identified counties that issued mandatory evacuation orders for evacuation zones.
          These areas become the primary origins of evacuees traveling toward Georgia.

        <h2>🧑🏻‍🤝‍🧑🏻 Visitor Share Change in Georgia</h2>
        <p>
          To quantify how destinations in Georgia were affected, we computed
          <em>visitor share change</em> for each census tract. This metric measures how much
          a tract’s share of visitors from Florida increased during the hurricane week
          relative to its typical share under normal conditions. If a tract normally receives <em>n</em>% of visitors but receives
          <em>(n + d)</em> % during the storm, the increase <em>d</em> captures the additional demand placed on that area.
        </p>
        <p>
          As shown in the histogram below, most tracts experienced modest changes, but a
          small subset saw disproportionately large increases. This heavy right tail
          indicates that evacuees did not disperse evenly.
        </p>

    <!-- Why Quantile Regression -->
        <section id="quantile-regression" class="section">
          <div class="container">
            <h2>🛠️ Quantile Regression Analysis</h2>
            <p>
              As seen in Figure 4, the distribution of visitor share change is highly skewed. However, a standard
              linear regression focuses on the mean and would mostly describe what happens in
              “typical” tracts, potentially missing the dynamics that matter most for
              evacuation response, the places that become hotspots.
            </p>
            <p>
              Quantile regression is designed for this type of problem. Instead of estimating
              how predictors affect the average outcome, it estimates their effects at
              different points of the distribution (for example, the 10th, 50th, or 90th
              percentile of visitor share change). This allows us to see how the role of
              social ties, accessibility, or amenities changes between lightly affected areas
              and those experiencing extreme increases in evacuee arrivals.
            </p>
            <figure class="card">
              <img src="img/quantile.png" alt="Quantile regression" style="max-width:600px"/>
            </figure>
            <p>
              This approach is well suited to evacuation data for several reasons:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                It captures <strong>heterogeneous effects</strong>, showing that some factors
                matter mainly for high-visitor tracts rather than everywhere.(Rodriguez & Yao, 2017)
              </li>
              <li>
                It is more robust to <strong>outliers and heavy tails</strong> than mean-based
                models, which is important when a few tracts receive a disproportionate number
                of evacuees. (Liao & Wang, 2012)
              </li>
              <li>
                It does not require constant variance of errors, making it appropriate when
                variability grows with the level of visitor change.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Interpretation follows the same logic: a positive coefficient for a variable at
              the 0.9 quantile means that, holding other variables constant, an increase in
              that variable raises the 90th percentile of visitor share change. If the same
              coefficient is close to zero at the median, we learn that the factor is
              especially important for <em>high-impact</em> destinations rather than for the
              average tract. This perspective helps identify which characteristics are most
              strongly associated with becoming an evacuation hotspot.

        <h2>🔍 Determinants of Visitor Concentration</h2>
        <p>
          The quantile regression results provide a detailed picture of what drives
          evacuees toward particular destinations in Georgia.
        </p>

          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          <strong>Social ties</strong> play a central role: tracts with stronger
          social connections to Florida origins attract significantly
          more evacuees, particularly at upper quantiles. This highlights how personal
          networks guide destination choice when uncertainty is high.

        </figure>
        <p>
          <strong>Distance and accessibility</strong> measures also matter. Greater
          distance from the storm’s trajectory is associated with slightly higher visitor
          shares, reflecting risk avoidance. Proximity to POI centers and to
          the Atlanta airport has strong positive effects in higher quantiles.

        <p>
          Finally, <strong>amenities and local context</strong> shape concentration.
          Hospitality infrastructure, specifically hotels and malls, is positively associated
          with visitor surges, while gas stations show weaker or even negative
          relationships at the top of the distribution. Higher-income destination tracts also tend to experience larger
          increases among the most-visited locations.

       <h2>Discussion &amp; Conclusion</h2>
       <p>
         Taken together, the results show that evacuation destinations are not chosen
         randomly or evenly across space. Instead, evacuees visited to a relatively
         small set of tracts that combine strong social ties to Florida, good regional
         accessibility, and available hospitality POIs. These places
         could effectively function as informal hubs in the evacuation network.
       </p>
       <p>
         From a planning perspective, this means that managing hurricane evacuations is
         not only about moving people out of high-risk areas, but also about preparing
         the locations that are most likely to receive them. Enhancing shelter capacity,
         fuel availability, and logistical support in socially connected, amenity-rich,
         and well-connected destinations can reduce congestion and strain on local
         systems during future events.
       </p>

         </figcaption>
       </figure>

       <p>
         Moreover, future work could examine how resource availability, housing markets, and information
         access affect who is able to reach safer, better-served destinations and who is
         left with fewer options. Furthermore, in the receiving places' perspective, researchers should identify evacuation hotspots and
         predict the impact of population influx on resource demands and economic stability.
       </p>
       <p>
         Finally, the study illustrates the value of combining large-scale mobility data
         with social network measures and distribution-sensitive models such as quantile
         regression. This framework can be extended to other hazards, receiving regions,
         and time periods to better understand how human mobility contributes to
         regional resilience in a changing climate.
